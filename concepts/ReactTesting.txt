Jest

Unit test
Is a short, focused test that checks if a single piece of code (like a function or method) works as expected in isolation, without dependencies.

Integration test
Checks how multiple components or modules work together, ensuring they interact correctly as a group (e.g., a component using a service or API).

E2E test
Simulates real user behavior by testing the entire application flow—from the UI to the backend—to ensure all parts work together as expected.

Mocking
Means creating fake versions of functions, modules, or services to simulate their behavior, so you can test code in isolation without relying on real implementations (like APIs or databases).

Snapshots
Is a saved serialized output of a component’s rendered UI or value, used to detect unexpected changes by comparing future test runs against the stored snapshot.

Jest
Is a JavaScript testing framework used to write and run tests. It provides tools for unit, integration, and snapshot testing with built-in mocking and assertion support.

Describe
Is a function used to group related tests together, making your test suite more organized and readable.

It
Is a function used to define an individual test case, specifying what behavior or output should be tested.

Expect
Is used to create assertions that verify if a value meets certain conditions in a test.

BeforeAll
Is a function that runs a setup callback once before all tests in a test suite, useful for expensive or shared setup.

BeforeEach
Is a function that runs a setup callback before every test in a test suite, useful for initializing conditions.
 
AfterEach
Is a function that runs a cleanup callback after every test in a test suite, useful for resetting states or mocks.
 
FireEvent
Is a utility that triggers DOM events (like click, change) directly on elements to simulate user interactions in tests.

UserEvent
Is a utility that simulates realistic user actions (like typing, clicking, tabbing) by firing multiple related events to mimic actual browser behavior.

WaitFor
Is used to wait for asynchronous changes in the DOM before making assertions—helpful when testing components that update after API calls or timers.
